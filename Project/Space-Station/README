HTML and CSS Projects

This is one of the websites I made using HTML and CSS.

•	SPACE STATION SITE
This page was created as a booking site for the Space Station. Including on the site are Gallery where you can 
checkout the images of the outer space and explore your option, and most importantly it contained the reservation 
section where you can reserve your flight. 

•	METHOD
I used the HTML to build the structure of the site using basic CSS and used HTML elements and attributes. After I build the structure, 
I used the CSS to styled using elements to color, measures and input borders to each section or images on the site as well as to home
each object on the site. The elements I utilized from the HTML’s are the hypertext reference to link on CSS files, link outer space 
images that is being displays on the website, and I link each section of the webpage to the navbar. I also use the form element to create 
my reservation section.
