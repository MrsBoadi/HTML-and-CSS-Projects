•	ACADEMY CINEMAS

Summary
This is to showcase our welcoming Cinemas located in Downtown Portland Oregon.  The site contains the movies that 
will be playing and the schedules for each of them.  You can submit your email to earn rewards for each visit to the Cinema.

•	Method used in creating the website.
I mainly used the HTML to construct the webpage and Boostrap 4 to style the site. HTML was used to build the 
structure of the site, linking using hypertext reference for my images and to link each section to my navbar. 
The navbar on the website contain the drop-down menu containing the About that lead you to the section where 
the introduction of the website is located, showtime that will direct you to the shows and the deals for our 
rewards program. In the navbar also has a search button. As I styles the website in input each object accordingly 
so it can merge into each bootstrap that I utilized for each object.  After I input all elements and necessary object, 
I debugs my coding than run it before commit and push my code to my GitHub account.
